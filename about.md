### Q: What is a furry convention?

Also known as a furry con or fur con, a furry convention is a large gathering of those in the [furry fandom](https://whatarefurries.com/). At these multi-day events, those in the fandom meet up, patronize vendors, and attend smaller events called "panels".

These conventions are held in hotels or convention centers. Furry conventions usually raise money for charity (including FurSquared).

There is no minimum level of "furriness" needed to attend. You do not need a fursuit, fursona, or interests in certain topics to attend - even those just curious about the fandom are welcome!

### Q: Which charity does FurSquared support?

FurSquared has been delighted to partner with [Humane Animal Welfare Society (HAWS) of Waukesha County](https://hawspets.org/) since the convention’s inception. We are pleased to welcome them back in 2025 and encourage our attendees to support them in any way they are able. Whether it is a few dollars contributed through the wide variety of charity-based paneling and events, sharing their mission with others via word of mouth, every contribution matters.

HAWS is a non-profit organization established in 1965 that assists over 6,000 animals each year and welcomes more than 31,000 human visitors annually. As an “open admissions” shelter, they accept animals regardless of age, health, temperament or breed. They also offer programs and services that promote responsible pet ownership, preventing animal abuse and neglect in the community. HAWS promotes the humane care and treatment of all animals, in support of cooperative humane efforts throughout the state of Wisconsin. HAWS is a member of the Wisconsin Federated Humane Societies.

### Q: How can I keep up with what’s happening with the con?

We’ll be posting updates here on the website [RSS](https://fursquared.com/feed), [Twitter / X](https://x.com/fursquared), [Telegram](https://t.me/fursquared), and [Mastodon](https://mastodon.furrycon.social/@fursquared).

### Q: What is your COVID-19 policy?

Proof of vaccination for COVID-19 will no longer be required to attend FurSquared, however we strongly urge everyone to keep their vaccinations up-to-date, especially when reformulated boosters become available to the general population. Additionally, while FurSquared encourages masks for all attendees in public and convention spaces, masks will not be required.

As we have learned in the past, a new variant of COVID-19 can appear and change everything, from transmission to severity. Because of this, FurSquared reserves the right to amend these requirements should it become necessary in order to ensure the safety and well-being of our staff and attendees.

Any modifications to this policy will be published on this page and announced through our social media channels and website.

### Q: Will there be a fursuit parade?
The convention will not be hosting a fursuit parade in 2025 through the convention space. Furwaukee (a group of local furries) and our guest of honor (Lilia Roo) will be hosting a furwalk from the Hilton to sights in the area, including the famous Bronze Fonz statue! See our [schedule](/programming) for more information.
