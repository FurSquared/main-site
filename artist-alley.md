subtitle: The artist alley runs on a lottery-based system! Every day is a new chance for a space to sell your wares. Tables are free, but limited in number!
---

## How to Participate:

* Sign ups are available before the convention weekend using our [vendor registration system](https://vendors.fursquared.com/).
* All who fill out the form will be added to a Telegram channel where results will be posted prior to the convention weekend (unless you choose to opt out, in which case you will be contacted via email/text).
* Results will be randomized, but weighted in order to be as fair as possible.
* All 3 days of results and waitlists will be posted before the con. Please post in the telegram chat to let us know if you are unable to attend, or would otherwise like to be removed from the list on any given day.
* Note that we are collecting tax information! Please plan accordingly.
* If your name is chosen in the lotto, you will have 1 hour to set up before opening starts. There will be a 15 minute grace period after opening to check in and claim your table before your spot will be forfeit to the next person on the waitlist.
* Please remember to check out at the info desk when you leave the alley for the day!

## Rules for Selling in the Alley

* **Nothing may be placed on the walls.** This is a historical hotel, please be respectful. This rule is taken very seriously- consequences may include being removed from the artist alley for the entire weekend or even having your badge revoked.
* Each person gets ½ of a table with a roughly 2 foot/cube height allowance. Please be reasonable and respectful of your neighbors.
* You must remove all of your belongings each day, even if you are in for consecutive days. You may not store items in the room overnight.
* There will be no access to outlets. Please bring a power bank if needed. A laminator will be available to use at the info desk. Lamination sheets will be provided for a $1 donation to charity if you do not have your own.
* If you are away at your table for longer than 30 minutes, your spot may be forfeit to the next person on the waitlist. Exceptions may be allowed in certain circumstances but please communicate with the head of AA if needed. We cannot be held responsible for your table or items on it while you are absent. If your table is considered abandoned without notice and we cannot reach you, your items will be removed from the table so that the spot can be freed up for someone waiting.
* Please use headphones if you would like to listen to music. We love music too but it can be overwhelming in a busy room!
* Don’t starve yourself but please keep meals reasonable. Try to keep food and drinks off of your table as much as possible and keep lids on drinks. Protect the art!

## Artwork and Merch Guidelines

* All artwork should be created by YOU! Everything used on your displays as examples as well as any manufactured items, if any, should prominently feature your own work.
* AI “art” is not allowed.
* NSFW/18+ pieces should be clearly marked and censored. Ideally in a separate binder if applicable. There will be minors in attendance and it is your responsibility to make sure to verify age before allowing access to these items.
* You should be able to work on something you are selling at your table. SOME kind of customized item or on-the-spot commission should be available for purchase and be the main focus of selling in artist alley.
* Keep large premade “merch” items to a minimum including clothing, fursuit parts/props, bags, pillows, etc. They are allowed *sparingly*, but again, should not be the focus of selling in artist alley and having more than 1-2 of these items are likely to encroach on your neighbor’s space as well.
* Small, supplemental items like stickers/keychains/pins etc are allowed as long as they feature your own artwork and displays are reasonably sized.
