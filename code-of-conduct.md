## General Rule

The following general rule supersedes all others listed below and may be invoked at any time:

### FurSquared’s Purpose

The primary purpose of FurSquared is to raise funds for animals through our charity, [HAWS](<https://hawspets.org/>)! We reach this purpose through this Code of Conduct that all attendees, volunteers, and staff abide by. FurSquared welcomes all parties with an interest in anthropomorphic animals. In order to achieve this welcoming environment, FurSquared Leadership reserves the right to deny or revoke the attendance of any individual at any time for any reason defined in this Code of Conduct.

## Code of Conduct Overview

The organization that owns the FurSquared Convention is Two Ferrets Co. The Board of Two Ferrets Co reserves the right to amend this Code of Conduct at any time without prior or posted notice and reserves the sole right of interpretation.

Transactions should take place through direct in-person communication. In the interest of maintaining the security of sensitive financial information, no divulging of personal financial information or sale of merchandise should take place outside the Dealer’s Den, Night Market, and Artist Alley. Solicitation for any sales outside of aforementioned sanctioned areas are not permitted except in the F2 Convention Chat on Telegram if approved by a moderator of that official chat.

The Night Market is restricted to persons of the ages 18 and above. Attendees must present a form of legal identification proving age of 18 prior to being allowed admittance to The Night Market. No attendee under the age of 18 shall be admitted to The Night Market, accompanied by an adult or otherwise. With this procedure, individual Night Market vendors are not required to check identification prior to completing sales.

## NFT’s & AI Images

FurSquared prohibits the sale and/or promotion of anything related to NFTs (Non Fungible Tokens). FurSquared prohibits the sale and/or promotion of “AI images”. AI Images are defined as any media created entirely by, assisted by, or edited by means of AI. This includes heavily edited media that originated from AI output. If a report of any of these occurring is received, the perpetrating vendor(s)’ will be investigated. If the report and investigation conclude the violation of this policy, the vendor(s)’ status will immediately be revoked and they will be required to remove their items from the convention space, with the possibility of not being allowed to vend at future FurSquared events.

## Use of FurSquared Media

FurSquared attendees should be aware that audio and/or video recordings are frequently made in convention areas and that their likenesses may appear in those recordings. Individual attendees agree to assign without compensation the use of their likeness(es) at FurSquared for the use of promotional material.

The name “FurSquared” and FurSquared logo(s) are service marks of Two Ferrets Co and may not be used in any fashion that disparages or dilutes that mark. Any and all attendees of FurSquared agree to remove from circulation or publication any media that in the sole opinion of Two Ferrets Co misrepresents or defames its service mark.

## Payments to FurSquared and Other Money Matters

Two Ferrets Co is a registered 501(c)(3). Donations to FurSquared can be tax deductible. Please seek legal and financial advice from licensed professionals if you have a question on your taxes.

For the Charity Auction, payments made for items made can receive a receipt for the transaction. If a receipt is needed, the purchaser must ask for proof of purchase at the auction upon receiving the item.

FurSquared accepts Visa, MasterCard, American Express, Discover, JCB. FurSquared also supports payments through Apple Pay, Google Pay, Samsung Pay, Afterpay, and Klarna.

FurSquared will not accept Checks as payment. Chargebacks (denying a charge) that are made for the sole purpose of avoiding payment, made without sufficient cause, and/or made without first attempting to resolve the dispute with FurSquared may result in permanent revocation of attendance privileges and possible legal action. FurSquared will investigate all chargebacks.

FurSquared will not involve itself in financial disputes between individual attendees, and will not divulge information about an individual attendee to any party unless provided with written requirement from an applicable local, state, or federal law.

### Miscellaneous Notes

The standards of conduct for FurSquared will be strictly enforced by FurSquared staff, who will be clearly identified as such. If you have an issue with any action taken by a Staff member or volunteer, please note at least the badge name, and number if possible. You then may go to our Security team (Dorsai, 4th floor of the Hilton) to submit your report. You may also request a Board Member to be present to hear your report so an appropriate decision and action can be taken based on severity, and proof.

This Code of Conduct is only enforceable to the extent that FurSquared staff is aware of and can follow up on any violations that arise. If you notice someone behaving destructively, negatively, or negligent, notify an identified staff member. A designated member of leadership will then move forward with agreed upon procedures to resolve the situation.

The Board may, upon receipt of information, ban or bar someone from FurSquared event spaces or FurSquared events based on a ban, bar, or notice from other legal entities (venues, organizations, conventions, online platforms, law enforcement, etc), given the following: the Board has gone to every effort to ensure those bans are reputable, and not rooted in interpersonal issues, bias, or malice; the ban or bar was enacted due to harassment, violence, or physical, sexual, emotional abuse, or incitement of any of the above.

Please be reminded that these rules may involve “worst-case” scenarios and are put into place to ensure the safety and comfort of attendees of the convention. These rules are also not all-inclusive. As stated at the beginning of this Code of Conduct, the main rule is as follows:

Any action or behavior that disrupts convention operations, causes discomfort to others, or harms FurSquared’s relationship with its guests, venues, or the public is strictly prohibited. Such actions may result in removal from the event, permanent suspension, and/or legal action.

FurSquared is prepared to deal with the above scenarios and more in as rapid and efficient a manner as possible. We thank our attendees for their past cooperation and for their continued assistance in making this a safe and enjoyable experience for everyone. Have fun - just please remember to be courteous and considerate of those around you while doing so!
