# Hilton Milwaukee

The Hilton Milwaukee, originally opened in 1928 as the Milwaukee Schroeder Hotel, is a historic hotel that is hosting our convention this year! Developed by Walter Schroeder, it was one of the largest and most luxurious hotels in the Midwest. Acquired by Hilton in 1972 and renamed, it has since undergone renovations to combine its lavish historic elegance with modern amenities, continuing to be a prominent downtown Milwaukee attraction.
