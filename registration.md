## **Minors, Parents, Guardians & Caregivers Attending FurSquared**

### Minors and their Parents/Guardians

FurSquared is committed to providing a fun, welcoming, and safe environment for all attendees, including minors. To ensure the safety and well-being of minors attending the event, the following policy is in place:

* No Minor, or anyone with a Parent-in-Tow or Kid-in-Tow badge, will be granted access to 18+ spaces/events or to the charity auction.

* Minors, 13 years old and younger at time of registration may receive a Kid-in-Tow badge when accompanying a parent/guardian (18 or older), with a paid attendee, or higher tier badge. They also must be accompanied by a parent/guardian, at all times while attending our convention. Security will be notified if any minors are found unaccompanied.

* Minors, 14-17 years old at time of registration must present a consent form that has been signed by their parent or guardian in-person at registration (or signed and legally notarized, if the parent/guardian is not present). We cannot, and will not, release a badge to a minor until either, they present the correctly filled-out form or their parent/guardian is present.

  * \*Minor Consent form available [HERE](https://static.fursquared.com/documents/f2-2025-consent-form.pdf).

* Parents/Guardians of Minors, 14-17 years old, at time of registration may request a Parent-in-Tow badge so that they can accompany their minors as they enjoy the con space. 

In addition, a maximum of 2 (two) KIT OR PIT badges may be requested per 1 (one) paid attending, or higher, level badge. At least 1 (one) badge must be purchased in order to request any KIT or PIT badges.


## **To read our full policy regarding minors and attendance, including steps on how to request a KIT or PIT badge, click** [HERE](https://fursquared.com/minors-policy/).  
If you have any further questions, please reach out to [registration@fursquared.com](mailto:registration@fursquared.com).

### Guardians and Caregivers

For those accompanying someone to the convention as a Caregiver and required to be with them at all times, we offer our Caregiver Badge. The Caregiver Badge allows someone to bring along 1 (one) person, as their Caregiver, to accompany them as they enjoy the con space.

* There must be at least 1 (one) paid, attending, or higher tier, badge purchased to request a Caregiver Badge.  
* Only 1 (one) Caregiver Badge allowed per Attendee  
* Caregiver Badges allow access to almost all of the same spaces that the Attendee’s badge allows, however, the Caregiver must be with the Attendee in order to access the space themselves. (Unfortunately, at this time, this access does NOT include the Sponsor Dinner, if applicable)  
* Caregiver Badges Do NOT grant access to any perks, swag, sponsor dinner, or any other extra features of being a Sponsor, or Super Sponsor, even if the Attendee has purchased the highest tier badge offered.  
  * The only exception is access to Con Suite and front-of-line or early-entry access to panels or spaces, if offered at the event AND the paid attendee is Sponsor or higher tier.  
    * Should the person(s) with the Caregiver Badge wish to attend sponsor dinner or receive any other perks, they must upgrade their free badge. A request should be made by emailing [registration@fursquared.com](mailto:registration@fursquared.com) after registering the Attendee, but before arriving at the convention, to ensure availability of upgrade spots for the attending Caregiver/Guardian. There are NO guarantees of availability of upgrades on site/once the convention has started.
       
* Please reach out to [registration@fursquared.com](mailto:registration@fursquared.com) so we can assist you ahead of time.  
  or  
* Click [HERE](https://static.fursquared.com/documents/f2-2025-register-guardian.pdf) for steps on how to register the attendee if a Caregiver badge is needed.

### Definitions:

* Parent or Guardian: FurSquared defines this as a person(s) who is at least 18 years old, and responsible for the welfare of someone who is a minor, or under the age of 18\.

* Caregiver/Guardian: FurSquared defines this as a person(s) who is at least 18 years old, and provides care, support, and assistance to individuals who are unable to perform daily activities on their own due to age, disability, or illness.

Thank you for your cooperation.

## **COVID-19 Information**

Proof of vaccination for COVID-19 will no longer be required to attend FurSquared, however we strongly urge everyone to keep their vaccinations up-to-date, especially when reformulated boosters become available to the general population.   
Additionally, while FurSquared encourages masks for all attendees in public and convention spaces, masks will not be required.   
As we have learned in the past, a new variant of COVID-19 can appear and change everything, from transmission to severity. Because of this, FurSquared reserves the right to amend these requirements should it become necessary in order to ensure the safety and well-being of our staff and attendees.   
Any modifications to this policy will be published on this page and announced through our social media channels and website.

## **Additional FAQ**

### What kind of ID is valid for checking in to get my badge during registration?

* We require you to have a government issued ID that has your picture and date of birth on it along with a legal first and last name. If you have changed your name the ID’s first and last legal names should match that which was submitted during your registration.

  * If your name has changed on your ID since registering and you need to update it Email [registration@fursquared.com](mailto:registration@fursquared.com)

  * Alternatively you would need to bring documentation that your Name has been changed, along with your photo ID when you pick up your Badge.

### I’m under 18 or I’m bringing a minor. Do they need an ID as well?

* If you are attending alone but have a signed consent form that was legally notarized, you will be fine, but you must have your consent form filled out by a legal notary. Failure to comply with notarizing the form will result in your registration being withheld until a guardian is present.

* If you are a guardian accompanying the minor during the registration process, you can sign the consent form at the door and no ID for the minor will be required. They will still need to register if they are above the age of 13 but will not be required to show ID if the paid attending adult is with them during the registration process.

### Help\! I’ve lost my badge at the convention\! What should I do?\!?\!

* All lost badges must be reported as soon as possible.

* Please return to the registration desk and inform our staff that the badge was lost and a reprint is required.

  * Unfortunately, the attendee will have to pay the cost of a new registration, however, should the badge turn up at any point before closing ceremonies, just bring both badges back to registration, we will destroy the copy and issue a refund.

  * Reprint cost: See [Registration Prices](#pricing) above.

### Help\!\! I’ve lost my swag and/or meal tickets that I received for being a Sponsor, Super Sponsor, or Poster level attendee\! What should I do?\!?\!?\!

* Unfortunately, lost swag and/or meal tickets cannot be replaced. It is the responsibility of the attendee to ensure the security of those items.

* If the attendee has never received pieces of swag and/or meal tickets that they are entitled to, it is the attendee’s responsibility to pick up those items before the con ends. FurSquared is not responsible for delivering these items to the attendee. If assistance is needed for picking up these items, please contact registration staff. 

### What’s Con Suite?

* While Con Suite might sound like it would be a cool hotel room to stay in overnight, it is not that, unfortunately, but what it actually is, is more of a Sponsor Lounge, a designated space on the convention floor, available to attendees with a sponsor badge or higher, offering complimentary snacks and beverages. It’s a place to step away from the crowds of the con, rest for a moment and grab a drink or snack, during the convention day. If you wish to stay the night at Fursquared, you will need to book your own hotel room.

  * Information about our hotel options can be found [HERE](https://fursquared.com/hotel/).
